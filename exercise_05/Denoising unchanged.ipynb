    "In the lecture you have learned that noise is inevitable in digital imaging. In the last exercise sheet you\n",
    "were asked to reduce noise in an image by averaging multiple shots of the same scene. However, averaging\n",
    "multiple images of moving objects/dynamic scenes under dim lighting conditions (think of a live concert,\n",
    "for example) is a delicate task. Also increasing the exposure time to gather more light is often not an option\n",
    "due to motion blur. As a result, there is only a very faint signal forming the image on the sensor.\n",
    "Using typical CCD or CMOS sensors, this signal can not be amplified without also amplifying noise.\n",
    "Hence, denoising is an important image processing task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big variety of algorithms that reduce noise from images in a post processing step. In this\n",
    "exercise you will first implement a measure to determine the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in an image, given\n",
    "the noise-free ground truth image. You will also implement a very easy, yet effective filter to remove noise\n",
    "from an image, namely the so-called _Bilateral Filter_.  \n",
    "A more powerful approach is the _Non-Local Means Filter_. In the second part of the exercise you will be guided through a simple implementation of this filter."
