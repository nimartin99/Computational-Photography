    "# 2.2 Demosaicing (30 + 40 + 20 = 90 points)\n",
    "Nowadays cameras acquire color photographs by means of using a color filter array (CFA). The most common of such CFAs is the Bayer pattern (see Figure 1). In this configuration each pixel only senses one out of the three primary colors, hence discarding about two-third of the incoming light. The recovery of the missed color information in each pixel is called demosaicing and requires quite tricky image processing to avoid the introduction of unsightly color artifacts. <br>A reasonable approach is to reconstruct the green channel first, since it has the best spatial distribution of the three color channels and therefore is less subject to noise. After the green channel is finished one can employ its information to reconstruct the red and blue channel."
